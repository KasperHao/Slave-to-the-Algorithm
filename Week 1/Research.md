Personally thinking, I like this kind of process placed on the intro page for a website or the enterring process for an APP. It made the whole page looks more fancy. It is minimalism, simple, which is the style I prefer to apply in my design. I think this can be used on the loading page as well instead of simply using dot which offen seen on so many platform.
