For this week, we mainly learning about how to play with typography.
One is displaying the rotating text and the other is text random drawing. What I found interesting is the first function that I have learnt. In general, I kinda confused why adding a rec can help the rotating text with fading effect. But I think it is really helpful for the website user interface design.
