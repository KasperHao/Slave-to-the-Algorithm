## Week 3

At first, I would like to thanks Karen for giving us an opportunity to get away from the laptop for a while. 

### Activity - Drawing machine.

For the drawing machine that I created, I use string to tie up one side of the marker, and use the clip to stable the other side on the curtain. With the open window, the string will move by the wind blow, and the marker will automatically move with the string.
