This week is 'PPP' session, Presentation for the project pitch. Each of us is require to present the pitch of the project that we want to do or want to create.

For me, I want to create a home dancing tutor, which is combining differernt techonology supports, action recognization, movement helping and holography. As I answered on the presentation, I do not think, presently I am able to make it happened. 
Therefore, for the final project, I will do something related to Dancing. Just like Louis mention, the system might able to obtain some movement of dancing, and then randomly generate it as a new choreography. I might try to figure out how to record the dance annotation as much as possible and then make the system can run it automatically.
