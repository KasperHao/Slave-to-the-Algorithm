This week we did a new processing function, p5.js, basically, this mode can be using to create a website code. In today's session, we used this mode to load a music file in processing. Further more, we also create a circle, which is able to extract with the volumne change.
To make it more interesting, I would like to learn how to make the circle extract and colour changing with the music volunme change.
