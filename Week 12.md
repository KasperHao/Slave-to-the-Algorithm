## Week 12

### Relection

### When we were choosing the studio, the first thought that popped into my mind is I want to learn something that is useful. For the whole study period in RMIT, I barely can find the studio knowledge that can really help me to improve greatly. For a design student, coding is complicated and more about math, I truly doubt that the decision of choosing the studio at first, but I find out every effort I put into the coding worth it.
### Generally speaking, the whole semester is around doing a unique project on our own. We create a proposal (the pitch), then we come out with the final design solution (final project) meanwhile, we document everything that we learn or relevant research about the project(SKO). The whole process makes me feel more confident to accept a job from others and being more skilful.
### For every session, I think it is not just teaching us how to code. It is more about how to use the coding knowledge that we learn from the course to establish an excellent generative design. Personally speaking, I do not achieve my goal for the project will poor skill and lack of knowledge, but I still pround of what I have done so far, and I will keep working on the design in the future.
